Homework Assignment One

I created main tag to encase all th encase all the contents of the page. I used to main tag in the css to center the page.
Within the main tag, I had three sections: <section id='top-page'>, <section id='bottom-page'>, <footer>
I changed the elements rom div to section; so it will be easier to track.
On content class, i created a content-box class to use it in css instead of using id for each section.
On benefits class, i created a benefit-box class to use it in css instead of using id for each section.

I created media query for (id='bottom-page'), so that I can stack content class ans benefits class, when I reduce page size.
I created media query to arrange nav bar content in one single column.
I created media query to adjust class content's image and text, when I reduce page size.
